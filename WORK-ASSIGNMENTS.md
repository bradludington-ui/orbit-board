# ORBIT work assignments

Brad controls assignments and release scope. Read this file and AGENTS.md before starting. Share each assignment with both sessions: this file does not provide a live communication channel or locking mechanism. Update assignments only in an authorized interactive task; scheduled monitors never write here.

## Standing lanes

| Role | Default owner | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Release implementation and integration | Claude | Board edits only on Brad's go and approved release scope |
| Independent review | Codex | Read-only review of exact main and all relevant PR head SHAs |
| Assigned fixes or tests | Agent explicitly named by Brad | Exclusive editing window; outgoing editor must stop first |
| Release gate | One owner explicitly named by Brad | No duplicate long gates; retain pinned evidence |
| Windows and native export acceptance | Brad or designated human operator | Synthetic disposable files; record versions and tested SHA |
| Merge and publication | Brad-authorized operator | Review completion alone does not authorize either action |

## Current implementation assignment

No implementation task is assigned by this setup. Existing sessions may still be active: confirm their status with Brad before editing code. The four recurring monitors retain read-only scope.

## Assignment template

- Task and approved scope:
- Owner and outgoing owner's explicit stopped status:
- Allowed files and excluded scope:
- Isolated branch and base commit SHA:
- Status: assigned / editing / ready for review / returned for fixes / accepted / closed
- Required bounded checks and designated gate owner:
- Handoff commit SHA and changed files:
- Commands, seeds, durations, exit statuses and results:
- Known risks, blocked checks and reviewer findings:
- Brad's integration/merge/publication authorization, if given:

## Message to paste into both sessions

> Read AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and WORK-ASSIGNMENTS.md. Work only on Brad's explicitly assigned scope in an isolated branch. One editing agent at a time, including tests. Do not assume another session has stopped. Hand off an exact commit SHA, changes, actual validation results and unresolved risks. If ownership is unclear, continue read-only work and ask Brad before edits. Recurring monitors remain read-only.
