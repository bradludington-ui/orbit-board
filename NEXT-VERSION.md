# Next version — queued changes

Changes are logged here as they come up and built together as ONE version when Brad says **go**.
Nothing on this list touches the board until then. On go: build every open item, run the full
math gate once, bump the version once, push once, and move the items to *Shipped* with the version.

Current version: **v1.84**. Next: **v1.85**.

## Open

### 8. Five-year spend plan: a tab per PMO, every appropriation, records with their requirements
- **Logged:** 24 Sep 2026, Brad: *"I need that report to pull by pmo so I need a pmo specific tab for
  each pmo that has requirements ... underneath that I need a list of their records so for instance
  jsf5594 then underneath that record I need to see the individual requirements listed that roll up
  ... the requirement for each fiscal year and the allocation right next to it ... 5 years which
  includes the base year plus four ... summary totals for each row at the far right ... summaries for
  each column at the bottom. It also needs to reference the ppbe cycle ... Within each pmo's tab I want
  to see all appropriations ... grouped by appropriation ... so that that's not one large listing."*
- **What Brad needs:**
  1. **One tab per PMO** that has requirements in any appropriation (tab name = the PMO, e.g. TSS).
  2. **Inside each tab, one table per appropriation** the PMO has requirements in — O&M, Full Fund,
     Initial Spares, OPN — each its own block with its own heading, never one long list.
  3. **Rows, in each block:** each **CCaR record** (e.g. JSF5594) as a roll-up line, with **the
     requirements filed under it** listed beneath it.
  4. **Columns:** for each of the five years (base year plus four), **Requirement** and **Allocation**
     side by side; at the far right, the **five-year totals** of each; at the bottom of each block,
     the **column totals**.
  5. **The PPBE cycle** the figures come from, named at the top of the tab and on each block.
  6. Every appropriation, every time the report is pulled.

##### What the code does today (read 24 Sep, v1.84)
- 📚 FYDP ▾ → 📊 Five-year spend plan… and ⬇ Export ▾ → 📊 FYDP Spend Plan (Excel) print **the open
  appropriation only**, from one source (the working plan, or a locked PPBE cycle), in three sheets:
  By Requirement (PMO groups, CCaR as a column), By PMO, By Service. Per year: Requirement,
  Allocated, Funded, Unfunded (and the ACE estimate when one is chosen).
- There is **no per-PMO tab** and **no grouping by CCaR record**.
- **Locked cycles** are stored for all four appropriations, so a locked cycle can be read for every
  appropriation. **The working plan** is computed only for the appropriation on screen; the other
  three would have to be computed without switching the board.

##### How it would work (proposed; say if any of it is wrong)
- **Added to the existing workbook**, after By Requirement / By PMO / By Service, which stay as they
  are: one sheet per PMO, in the board's PMO order.
- **Allocation** is the board's *Allocated* figure for that year — what the RECORD panel shows as
  ALLOCATED (discretionary + mandatory for a requirement on Split). Funded and Unfunded stay on the
  existing sheets.
- **Source:** whatever is chosen in 📊 Five-year spend plan — the working plan (with its PPBE tag, and
  the reference cycle if one is set) or a locked cycle. With a locked cycle chosen, an appropriation
  that has no lock under that cycle says so in its block rather than quietly printing the working plan.
- **A requirement with no CCaR record** is listed under *No CCaR record* at the end of its block.
- **A year the source does not hold** prints an em dash, never 0, and stays out of the totals (the
  existing report's rule).
- **No grand total across appropriations** on a PMO tab: the money in the four blocks is not the same
  kind of money. Say if you want one.

##### Can't-fail checks for the build
- **Ties to the dollar:** for every PMO and appropriation, each year's Requirement and Allocation
  totals on the PMO tab equal that PMO's subtotal on the appropriation's own By PMO sheet; each
  record line equals the sum of the requirements under it; each row's five-year total equals its
  years; each block's bottom line equals its rows.
- **Nothing moves:** computing the other appropriations never changes any appropriation's stored
  plan, the one on screen, or anything the board saves (byte-for-byte before and after).
- **Every requirement appears exactly once**, under its own PMO, appropriation and record.
- Mutations for each of the above, and the full math gate.
- **Help and training:** a slide for the portfolio team (Session B, the products) and a line in the
  road-show notes.


## Withdrawn

### 1. PIDs show up in the CCaR column of the Excel workbook
- **Withdrawn 23 Sep 2026 by Brad:** the PID is in the right column now. No change.
- What testing had shown, kept for the record: the export places the CCaR number and the PID in
  their own columns on every sheet, including a requirement with a PID and no CCaR number.

## Shipped

### v1.84 — 24 Sep 2026: items 4, 5, 6 and 7, built together on Brad's "go"

What shipped differs from the log in two places, both stated here:
- **The UPL mark stays with the portfolio team.** It turned out to be the funding realignment's own
  marker, keyed by funding pool rather than by requirement, so it is not a field of the requirement.
- **The minimum useful increment now travels** (it was deliberately held back before v1.84), because
  the owner asked for every field except the allocation.
- **Also fixed on the way:** an appropriation package's preview could say "nothing changed" when it
  would replace notes, descriptions or record fields; it now names every container that differs.

#### 4. A PMO copy still offers Save and says "unsaved changes"
- **Logged:** 23 Sep 2026, found while checking the PMO guide against a v1.83 grid copy; Brad
  asked for it to be logged.
- **What an office sees:** the header of a PMO copy shows `💾 Save` and "• unsaved changes" as soon
  as anything is edited, and the line under the toolbar says "Make changes and 💾 Save to pass it
  on". Pressing Save (or File ▸ Save a copy…) is refused with "Saving to the shared file is turned
  off here". The refusal is right; the invitation to press it is wrong, on the one copy whose only
  way out is ✉ Submit input.
- **What is needed:** on a PMO copy, the header and the status line point to ✉ Submit input (and
  say the work is kept in this browser), never to Save. The portfolio board is unchanged.
- **Until then:** the PMO guide tells offices to expect the Save button and ignore it.

#### 5. A refused appropriation switch leaves the box showing the other appropriation
- **Logged:** 23 Sep 2026, same check; Brad asked for it to be logged.
- **What an office sees:** on a PMO copy, picking another appropriation in the Appropriation box is
  refused ("This PMO copy holds the O&M portfolio only …"), as it should be, but the box keeps
  showing the name picked (say FULL FUND) while the board underneath is still O&M.
- **What is needed:** after the refusal the box shows the copy's own appropriation again.
- **Until then:** the PMO guide says to refresh the page if the box shows the wrong name.

#### 6. The PMO copy does the legwork: every field but the allocation, the office's own ranking, new requirements
- **Logged:** 24 Sep 2026, Brad: *"For the sandbox, I need them to be able to add requirements for the
  PMO, prioritize within their PMO, and be able to edit all available items within the requirement
  except for the discretionary and mandatory allocations. I need them to be able to send me completely
  updated requirements. We can always update in the master live file but I need them to do most of
  the legwork."* Help files and training are updated in the same version.
- **Decided 24 Sep (Brad):** the decision band and ★ Mission Critical travel like any other field.
  An accepted office ranking is **stored as that office's own ranking** on the live board; the
  master list changes only when the portfolio team moves rows by hand.

##### What the code does today (measured 24 Sep on a v1.83 grid PMO copy)
- A submittal carries **8 fields**: description, impact if not funded, note, requirement value by
  service, CCaR record, PID, CCaR record name, MIPR type. Everything else an office edits in its copy
  is kept in the copy and not sent (the PMO guide says so).
- **Adding a requirement** already works: it travels whole as a proposal once its mandatory fields
  are filled (v1.7x, backlog #1).
- **The office's own ranking** can be changed in the copy (🏢 PMO ▾ → your office, then drag) and is
  never sent.
- **DISC and MAND** can be typed in the copy and are not sent, so an office can believe it edited an
  allocation it did not.
- **A promise the board does not keep:** in office view the hint says "⇪ Apply PMO Ranks syncs it
  when you choose". There is no such control in either build, nor anywhere in the repository's
  history. With "store it only" decided, the hint is simply wrong and is reworded.

##### What travels in v1.84
| Field | Store | Today | v1.84 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Description, impact, note, requirement value, CCaR record, PID, record name, MIPR type | desc, cons, notes, asks, ccar, pid, recNames, mipr | sent | sent |
| Title / plan event | titles | kept in the copy | **sent** |
| PMO (reassigning a requirement) | grp | kept | **sent** (scope by the office that owned it when the copy was published, so a hand-over is not dropped as "another office's") |
| Prime contract / OGC | ptype | kept | **sent** |
| Obligation category | obCat | kept | **sent** |
| WBS | wbs, clinWbs | kept | **sent** |
| RCN / EEIC | rcnAsg, rcnSvc | kept | **sent** |
| Navy SI code | si | kept | **sent** |
| Goes to / which awards to | dest | kept | **sent** |
| Cost element (Full Fund) | costElem | kept | **sent** |
| BAE budget, per service and lane | budgetAsg | kept | **sent** |
| Award / obligation date, CR half-month | awards, crHalf | kept | **sent** |
| Minimum useful increment | minInc | kept | **sent** |
| UPL mark | upl | kept | **sent** |
| Decision band | band | kept | **sent** (decided 24 Sep) |
| ★ Mission Critical | mc | kept | **sent** (decided 24 Sep) |
| The office's own ranking | pmoOrder[office] | kept | **sent**; applied as that office's ranking only |
| **Discretionary and mandatory allocation** | alloc, fsrc | kept | **locked in the copy, never sent** |
| Prime CLIN drill (allocation to CLINs) | clinAlloc, clinMeta, clinNew, clinRm | kept | not sent: allocation, and the CLIN grid feeds nothing |
| Shortfall absorber, ACE mapping | absorber, aceMap | kept | not sent: funding mechanics and the portfolio's reconciliation |

##### How it works, end to end
1. **In the copy**, every field above is editable on the office's own requirements, and on new ones.
   DISC and MAND show read-only, labelled as the portfolio team's allocation.
2. **The submittal** carries each changed field with the value it had when the copy was published
   (so a conflict can be seen), plus the office's ranking when it changed, plus new requirements whole
   with every field.
3. **Submittal review** shows each field beside the board's current value, ticked field by field as
   today. The ranking is one row: the office's order before and after, applied as a whole.
4. **✔ Apply** writes only the ticked fields. The allocation stores are never written by a submittal.

##### Can't-fail checks for the build
- Round trip: every field above, set in a copy, arrives in review with the right before and after
  values and lands exactly on apply, on both builds; a conflict is flagged for each.
- A maximal submittal (every field, every requirement, a new ranking, a proposal) never changes a
  single allocation value (alloc, fsrc), and applying the ranking never moves the master order.
- An untouched copy still submits nothing ("Nothing to send yet").
- New mutations for each new field and for the allocation lock; the full math gate as always.

##### Help and training, same version
- PMO copy guide (web page and PDF): steps 4 and 5, "What travels", troubleshooting.
- Road-show deck: Session A slides on what you send back, the Lead Financial Manager checklist,
  "What travels"; Session B slides on review, and ranking.

#### 7. Take one appropriation back from a consolidated file
- **Logged:** 24 Sep 2026, Brad: *"I sent my O&M Lead the consolidated file and he is updating the
  O&M section. I need to be able to import only the O&M data when he's done."*
- **What the code does today (tested 24 Sep, v1.83 grid, example data):** ⬅ Import a previous board…
  on a consolidated `.html` seeds **all four** appropriations from that file. Measured: a Full Fund
  change made on the owner's board after the file went out was **replaced by the Lead's copy** of
  Full Fund. The only warning is the general "This REPLACES everything on this board" confirm.
  Execution data, cost estimates, the reprogramming log and locked cycles follow their own merge
  rules and were not the problem.
- **Works today, no change needed (tested the same way):** the Lead, in his consolidated copy,
  uses 📁 File ▾ → 🔁 Appropriation packages… → ⬆ Issue on the O&M row, and sends the `.json` it
  saves. Importing that on the owner's board replaced **O&M only**, after a preview of every change;
  Full Fund kept the owner's later edit, and execution, cost estimates and the reprogramming log
  were untouched. Caveat: it takes the Lead's O&M whole, so O&M edits the owner made meanwhile are
  replaced (the preview lists them). The button is named for the other direction ("Issue"), which
  is why this needs doing properly.
- **What is needed:**
  1. Importing a consolidated `.html` asks **which appropriations to take**, one tick box each, with
     the same per-appropriation preview a package gets; nothing ticked by default, and appropriations
     not ticked are left exactly as they are.
  2. The Lead's side gets a clearly named **⬆ Send this appropriation back…** in a consolidated
     copy, carrying what the appropriation looked like when the file was sent, so the owner's board
     can say which of its own changes would be replaced (the check a return package already has).
  3. Tests: a whole-file import with one box ticked changes only that appropriation, byte for byte;
     the other three, the BAE list, execution, cost estimates, reprogramming and cycles are
     unchanged; a conflict is flagged when the owner changed the same appropriation meanwhile.
- **Help and training:** add the hand-off to the road-show deck (Session B) and a short note in the
  help for appropriation leads.


### v1.83 — 23 Sep 2026: items 2 and 3, built together on Brad's "go"

#### 2. Spend Plan Source: full, verbatim BAE budget names, assigned automatically
- **Logged:** 23 Sep 2026, Brad. Photos of a Spend Plan Source export and of BAE names (USAF O&M,
  Marine Corps Full Fund, Spares, Modifications and O&M) are **examples only**: the logic must work
  from the structure of the names in whatever BAE file is imported, all 697 of them.
- **What Brad sees:** the Budget column says `USAF O&M`, `ANG O&M`, `USMC STOVL O&M`, `USN O&M`.
  CCaR rejects anything that is not the budget's name exactly as the BAE file spells it.
- **What Brad needs:**
  1. The full BAE name, verbatim, on every Spend Plan Source line, for O&M, Full Fund, Spares and OPN.
  2. Assigned automatically from the requirement's **service**, **lane** (discretionary dollars to a
     Discretionary budget, mandatory to a Mandatory one) and **PMO**.
  3. A requirement funded from both lanes gets **two lines per service**, one per lane.
  4. **Import the BAE once.** The list stays in the saved board and is there on every appropriation.
  5. **No BAE loaded: Budget left blank, with a warning** (decided 23 Sep), never a made-up name.
  6. **CONG and BOS only by hand** (decided 23 Sep); everything else automatic where it can be.

##### What the code does today (read and measured 23 Sep)
- **The BAE list is not kept across appropriations.** The import keeps every appropriation's names,
  but stores them in the open appropriation's own store. Switching appropriation reloads the board
  with a different store, so a list imported on O&M is absent on Full Fund, Spares and OPN, and the
  export falls back to made-up names. That is the reloading Brad has been doing. Nothing in the
  round-trip fuzz or the suites checks that the list survives a save.
- With no BAE loaded, the export makes a name up per service (`USAF O&M`).
- With a BAE loaded, a name is filled in only when exactly one fits. Rollup headings count as fits,
  CONG / BOS count as fits, and the lane only narrows when a requirement is wholly one lane — so it
  almost never gets to one: 3 or 4 fits in every O&M case tried, 6 to 10 on Full Fund.
- It misreads `USAF O&M NON AFRC NON ANG` as an ANG budget ("NON ANG" contains ANG).
- A requirement drawing both lanes gets one line per service, not one per lane.
- The BAE spelling is not uniform, so names are copied, never built: `O&M - ` / `O&M- ` / `O&M -1A9A`,
  `MxS` / `MXS`, `Full Mission Sims Discretionary TSS` on STOVL beside `Full Mission Sims TSS` on CV.

##### The rule (structural, no list of names in the program)
Every name reads as *service + appropriation + funding line + [Discretionary | Mandatory] + PMO*.
1. **No PMO in the name = a legacy budget, never usable** (decided by Brad, 23 Sep). It is never
   offered, never auto-assigned, and never taken over from last year's choice or from the CCaR pull:
   a requirement that arrives pointing at one is flagged for a fresh pick. Examples:
   `USAF O&M - ANG CAM`, `USAF O&M- BOS`, `USMC STOVL APN Spares Initial`, `USMC STOVL O&M -1A9A`,
   `USN APN Full Fund SUPT PES USN CV`. The PMO is read as the last word of the name
   (AV, MxS, PP, PSM, TSS, CDS, BOP, ATL, any case).
2. **Hand-pick-only lines:** CONG, BOS, OCO, Withhold and Spares **TrngDev** (all decided by
   Brad, 23 Sep). Never
   chosen automatically, never taken over from last year or the CCaR pull; offered only when
   Brad picks by hand.
   **Out of scope entirely:** Modifications, RDT&E and Flyaway budgets (decided 23 Sep). They are
   never offered, as today.
   **Spares TrngDev is part of the Spares board** (decided 23 Sep): a separate, low-dollar pot.
   Today the board ignores those names; they must be read as Spares budgets
   (`USMC STOVL APN Spares TrngDev AV`, `... TrngDev PP`, `... TrngDev TSS`) and offered by hand,
   so an ordinary Spares requirement still goes to its *Spares Initial* name automatically.
3. **Service, PMO, then lane exactly;** where the office's names carry no lane, its one lane-less
   name takes both lanes; where no name fits, the line is flagged, never guessed.
4. **The funding line.** O&M: CAM (hand-pick lines aside). **Full Fund: the requirement's cost
   element, one to one** (decided by Brad, 23 Sep). The board already holds a cost element per Full
   Fund requirement and carries it forward each year; a fixed table ties each of its cost elements
   to the words the BAE names use (all rows confirmed by Brad, 23 Sep):

   | Cost element on the board | Funding line in the BAE name |
   |---|---|
   | Airframe PGSE | Airframe PGSE |
   | Engine PGSE | ENGINE PGSE |
   | Avionics PGSE | Avionics PGSE |
   | Peculiar Training Equip | PEC TRNG |
   | Full Mission Simulators | Full Mission Sims |
   | Pubs/Tech Data | PUBS/TECH DATA |
   | Other ILS Production | OTHER ILS |
   | Fixed JPO Support | FIXED JPO SUPT POA |
   | Depot Standup Software | Depot Software |
   | Depot Standup Air Vehicle | Depot Standup (the PMO picks AV, PP or PSM) |
   | Depot Standup Propulsion | Depot Standup (the PMO picks AV, PP or PSM) |
   | JRE | the BAE line that names JRE, once one exists (CDS JRE requirements start next year); until then a JRE requirement is flagged for a hand pick |
   | **Production Engineering Support** *(new, #8 in the list)* | PES |

   Matching ignores case and spacing. A Full Fund requirement with **no cost element** is flagged to
   have one set, not guessed. Anywhere a line is still open after this (a new appropriation's
   pattern, say), the fallback is the line CCaR already files the record under, then last year's
   choice, then a one-time pick from only the lines that exist for that service and PMO.

**Measured on every example name sent (20 cases, the legacy rule applied):** 16 resolve to exactly one name with nothing
chosen — all USAF O&M, all Marine Corps O&M, Spares, and Full Fund BOP. For example:
ANG discretionary AV → `USAF O&M - ANG CAM Discretionary AV`; ANG CDS → `USAF O&M - ANG CAM CDS`;
STOVL O&M PSM → `USMC STOVL O&M -1A9A AT ATF Discretionary PSM`; STOVL Spares PP →
`USMC STOVL APN Spares Initial Discretionary PP`. With the cost element added (rule 4), **all 56 service + PMO +
cost element combinations in the Full Fund examples resolve to exactly one name**, e.g. STOVL PSM
on Other ILS Production → `USMC STOVL APN Full Fund SUPT OTHER ILS Discretionary PSM`, CV TSS on
Full Mission Simulators → `USN APN Full Fund SUPT USMC CV Full Mission Sims TSS`, STOVL BOP on Fixed
JPO Support → `USMC STOVL APN Full Fund SUPT FIXED JPO SUPT POA Discretionary BOP`. One (CV Spares PP) found none because the photo shows only its CONG
name; with the whole file it will find the ordinary one, or flag it.

##### Proposed fix
1. **Keep the BAE list once, for the whole board:** stored beside the appropriations rather than
   inside one, written into the saved file, read by every appropriation. A board saved with the old
   layout is moved over when it opens, so a list already imported is not lost.
2. Apply the rule above; read `NON AFRC NON ANG` as the active Air Force. Add **Production
   Engineering Support** to the board's cost elements as **#8, right before Fixed JPO Support**
   (Brad, 23 Sep; the name confirmed as *Production*, not Program), matched to `PES`. The list becomes: 1 Airframe PGSE, 2 Engine PGSE,
   3 Avionics PGSE, 4 Peculiar Training Equip, 5 Full Mission Simulators, 6 Pubs/Tech Data,
   7 Other ILS Production, **8 Production Engineering Support**, 9 Fixed JPO Support, 10 Depot Standup
   Software, 11 Depot Standup Air Vehicle, 12 Depot Standup Propulsion, 13 JRE. A requirement's cost
   element is saved by name, not number, so no existing choice moves; only a number typed into the
   cost element prompt follows the new order (checked 23 Sep: that prompt is the one place the
   board reads the list by position). A board saved before this loads unchanged.
3. Split each service's line by lane in the Spend Plan Source, each with its own budget, keeping the
   dollars whole — the lines still add to the funded total, held by the trace matrix and a mutation.
4. Print the name exactly as the BAE cell holds it (the leading indent trimmed, nothing else).
5. No BAE loaded: Budget blank, and a warning before the export.
6. Before export, list every line still without a budget, so nothing reaches CCaR blank by accident.
7. Tests: the round-trip fuzz fills the BAE list and proves it survives save, reopen and a switch of
   appropriation; the audits check the rule's picks and the lane split; mutations prove each check bites.

##### Needed before building — nothing; every question answered 23 Sep
1. ~~OCO and Withhold~~ — answered 23 Sep: by hand only.
2. ~~Modifications, RDT&E, Flyaway~~ — answered 23 Sep: stay out.
3. ~~Spares TrngDev~~ — answered 23 Sep: part of the Spares board, a low-dollar pot, by hand only.
4. ~~Full Fund default~~ — answered 23 Sep: the budget follows the cost element, one to one.
5. ~~Cost element table~~ — answered 23 Sep: Depot Standup Software → Depot Software; both Depot
   Standup cost elements → Depot Standup, with the PMO choosing AV, PP or PSM; PES is **Production
   Engineering Support**, a cost element the board is missing and gains in this version; JRE
   requirements (CDS) start next year, so JRE follows the BAE line that names it once one exists.

#### 3. Two Spend Plans: list every requirement, including the ones neither plan funds
- **Logged:** 23 Sep 2026, Brad, with a photo of requirement #98 of 151: FY27 requirement $50,000,000
  (USMC-B $21M, USMC-C $4M, USN $25M), allocated $0, unfunded $50,000,000, MC shortage, band 7.
- **What Brad sees:** #98 does not appear in the Two Spend Plans list or its export. It looks as if
  requirements are being skipped.
- **What the code does (read and tested 23 Sep):** the list keeps a requirement only if at least one
  plan funds some of it. A requirement funded under neither plan is dropped from the on-screen
  panel, both plan sheets and the A-vs-B sheet, with no line naming it. On a test board with three
  requirements, one of them wholly unfunded, both sheets list two, and the TOTAL line reads
  "2 of 3 requirements (1 ask for nothing and are in neither plan)". **That label is wrong:** the
  dropped requirement asks for money; it just gets none. No column shows a requirement's full value
  or its unfunded amount, so the list cannot show what is left unfunded. Its "Not covered" figure
  counts only allocated dollars a plan ran out before reaching.
- **Proposed fix:**
  1. List **every requirement**, in the board's priority order, on the screen panel and on all three
     sheets. One funded by neither plan is marked **NOT FUNDED — either plan**.
  2. Add **FY27 Requirement** and **Unfunded** (requirement minus what that plan funds) to every row,
     and an **UNFUNDED** line in each sheet's summary that ties to the board's own unfunded total.
  3. The TOTAL line counts all of them ("151 of 151 requirements") and names the unfunded ones
     correctly.
  4. A **Not funded** filter in the panel, beside the existing moved / cut / partial ones.
  5. Tests: an audit check that every requirement on the board appears on each sheet, a trace-matrix
     link for the new unfunded figure, and mutations that drop a row or restore the old label, so a
     skipped requirement can never pass silently again.
- **Needed before building:** nothing. Unfunded requirements stay **in rank order**, as on the board
  (decided by Brad, 23 Sep).
